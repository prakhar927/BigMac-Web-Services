# BigMac-Web-Services

In this project, we have three modules namely Machine Learning module, Big-data Analytics
module and Operating System Renting module. Through these modules, our target customers
are start-ups and individual researchers who face an initial financial struggle to develop an
infrastructure for using such technologies on their own; because these technologies require a
cluster of computers and require huge amount of space and maintenance cost.

#Overview of Machine Learning module-1
Machine Learning is of three types: Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning, and
Regression. During the development of this module, Regression is used to learn from the
dataset and implement predictive analysis. Pre-built regression models are provided that can
be directly used by the users for predictive analysis by entering the required data. There is also
a provision of creating custom models on the user dataset and make predictions.
This module can be used for making predictions like Match Prediction, meteorological
predictions, etc.

#Overview of Big Data module-2
To do Big Data analytics, Hadoop Framework is used. The file system used in Hadoop is called
HDFS which stores files in distributed manner. Hadoop uses Map-Reduce for distributed
computing. There are two ways in which user can do Big Data analysis by using pre-built MR
programs or users can upload their own separate Mapper and Reducer programs. The program
uploaded by the user should be a python script.
This module can be used in many ways, e.g., to find current regional trends by analysing social
networking sites’ data.

#Overview of OS Rental module-3
In this module, OpenStack Cloud is used. Using Nova (a service of OpenStack), the instance
creation process is accomplished. Now the created OS instance can be transferred either to the
user’s PC or on the mobile phone. To transfer the OS instance into the mobile this module uses
the QR code which redirects the device to the address of current running OS instance. A
separate QR code is generated for every instance that is created.
Since the OS instance is accessed through a browser window, it can be transferred to any lowend
device that has a web browser which supports https protocol.
